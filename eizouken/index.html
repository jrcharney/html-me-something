                <h2>About</h2>
                <p><b><i>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</i></b> is a Japanese manga series written by Sumito Ōwara about three high school girls who start a Motion Picture Club (<abbr title="literally translated">lit.</abbr> 「映像研」 or "Eizouken") where they make animated films. They distinguish themselves from the school's Anime Club since Asakusa wants to be creative, Mizusaki is forbidden from joining the Anime Club by her parents, and Kanamori wants do something that makes money.</p>
                <p>With Asakusa's imagination and ability to draw creative scenery, Mizusaki's ability for drawing figures and design, and Kanamori's shrewd but rational production skills, the girls create amazing features and slowly work towards making their "greatest world".</p>
                <p>The manga became an anime that premiered in 2020 and has also been made into a movie in Japan.</p>
